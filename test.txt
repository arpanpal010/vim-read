Renewable-energy supporters wonder if China is weaning itself off of coal as
quickly as it can, and if leaders will ever fulfill their promise of basing the
economy on consumption, not investment.

The species problem is a mixture of difficult related questions that often come
up when biologists define the word "species". There are a wide range of
approaches to defining how we identify species and how species function in
nature, each approach is known as a species concept. The number and types of
species concepts which exist are constantly changing, but there are at least 26
recognized species concepts.[2] Biological reality means that a definition that
works well for some organisms (e.g., birds) will be useless for others (e.g.,
bacteria) particularly due to concerns regarding if the species reproduces
asexually or sexually. The scientific study of the species problem has been
called microtaxonomy.
